;;; Commentary:

;; This is an interface to the chee program. Chee is a command line
;; tool for managing photos. This package provides a buffer to
;; conveniently execute the chee program. The results are displayed
;; using dired and image-dired.

;; Please see https://github.com/eikek/chee and
;; https://github.com/eikek/chee/tree/master/emacs for more
;; information.

;; Use this package by invoking `chee-query-open'. A few things can be
;; configured, but it is not necessary; see customize-group 'chee' for
;; options. The function `chee-setup-default' adds a key binding for
;; `chee-query-open' to `C-c C-s'.

;;; Code:
(require 'chee-settings)
(require 'chee-dired)
(require 'chee-query)

;;;###autoload
(defun chee-run-query-dired ()
  "Run the query from the chee-query buffer and display the
results in a dired buffer and thumbnails in
`image-dired-create-thumbnail-buffer'. Switch to the dired
buffer."
  (interactive)
  (let ((buf (current-buffer)))
    (apply 'chee-dired (chee-query-get-args buf))
    (when (and (cdr (window-list))
               (window-live-p (get-buffer-window buf)))
      (delete-window (get-buffer-window buf)))
    (switch-to-buffer (chee-dired-get-buffer))))
